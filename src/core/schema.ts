 *
 * It is deliberately small right now. The shape — a tree of nodes, each with a
 * `type` discriminator, a shared `transform`, and a per-type `props` bag — is
 * what lets later iterations add sprites, tilemaps, particles and the rest
 * without a format break.

 *
 * v2 added `sprite` and the project-level `assets` table. Files written by v1
 * still read fine here — `parseProject` fills in an empty asset table — but the
 * bump is about the other direction: a v1 build has no `sprite` case anywhere,
 * and an unhandled node type crashes its renderer rather than degrading. The
 * version check turns that crash into the "made with a newer version" message.
